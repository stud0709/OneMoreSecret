OneMoreSecret is an additional security layer for your data (e.g. passwords). It leverages the Android Keystore system, which is in fact a [hardware security module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module). In other words: with oneMoreSecret, you access all your secrets with your phone and your fingerprint. 

### Disclaimer
This is a very early version of the software. Use it at your own risk. We'll do our best to keep the message formats unchanged and guarantee the backward compatibility.

## What's wrong with password managers?
In the early days, the computers were not password protected. The first password [dates back](https://www.smh.com.au/national/scientist-who-introduced-the-computer-password-20190717-p527zf.html) to 1961. As things got worse, [password policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy) were born, together with the recommendation to have separate passwords for every application. This is how the [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) came into being - as a workaround for the password policy. You *kind of* have different passwords for every service, and still, there is only one password.

Don't get me wrong, [KeePass](https://keepass.info/download.html) and others have been doing a great job. But here are some concerns:

1. A security software with millions of installations is very attractive to hackers.
2. If you know the master password, you have access to the entire database. Not only you get a list of passwords, you also know where to log in - a typical password manager stores everything in one place. If you are extraordinary "smart", you will also store your [One Time Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) configuration in your password manager, thus bypassing the very idea of the [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication).
3. Even if there are some additional security measures to protect the password database (e.g. entering your password using Windows secure screen or protecting the database with the password and a key provider or a secret file), they are often not active in the default configuration of your tool. 
4. If you have gained access to a cloud password storage, you can collect literally millions of password **databases**!

My personal nightmare is a hidden code change in a password manager making it send the data to a third party. And yes, code changes to a cloud software apply for all customers in the same minute they are deployed... üí£

## Why OneMoreSecret?
...well, I am probably not the only one wondering if we are really better off with password managers or just storing all our credentials in one place for someone to come and collect them all at once. Maybe not today, but tomorrow...

If there is a vulnerability, there will be also an exploit for it. And it will work for a typical configuration. It is a good idea to be among those 1% with a setup, where the exploit will not work. 

...and I am fed up of typing my master password 40 times a day! ü§¨ If you enter your master password on multiple machines and different platforms many times per day - is it still something you call secure?

So here is the wish list I wanted to implement with oneMoreSecret:

### No Master Password
The encryption used in oneMoreSecret is based on keys, not a password phrase. Yes, it's the old good [asymmetric cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) wrapped into a handy tool. 

### No Context
Every password is stored separately in its own encryption envelope. And every password is sent to the phone for decryption separately and without context. So even if someone steals a password, he will still have to figure out, what it is good for. 

### Store It Your Way
It's your ~~problem~~ choice how to store your credentials. You could use a text file with the service name, user name and the encrypted password. You could use Excel, Notepad, Google Keep, or GitHub Gists. You could also conitnue using KeePass (it has a very comfortable user interface after all ‚ù§Ô∏è) and put your encrypted password into the password field: 

![oms ontop KeePass](readme_images/oms_ontop_keepass.png)

If your database is stolen, the guys will still end up with encrypted password. 

Personally, I prefer to store my KeePass database in the cloud storage. The file is encrypted, synced between your devices and protected from data loss.

### No Private Key Exposure 
The Android Keystore system does not "hand over" the key to the app. Once the key has been imported into the storage, you cannot extract it from the phone any more. 

The only way to restore your private key is the backup file (or paper document) together with the transport password. ‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT share this document and password with others as this will grant access to all data encrypted by this private key. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Login without a password
...yes, I know, there is [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/). But hey, with oneMoreSecret, your users can share their public key with you - with one click. Now you can generate a one-time verification code for the user, encrypt is with his key and show it as a QR sequence on your login page ([omsCompanion](https://github.com/stud0709/oms_companion) has already all the logic written in Java). 

Login from a mobile device? No problem. omeMoreSecret will respond to clicks on URLs with scheme `oms:`. Just add the encrypted message (`<a href="https://oms-app-intent/oms00_.....">Mobile Log-In</a>`). You will find a sample link in our ["Hello, World!" Tutorial](hello_world.md#step-5-mobile-phone-integration).

## How It Works
If you store your passwords on your desktop computer, [omsCompanion](https://github.com/stud0709/oms_companion) will convert your encrypted data into a QR code sequence as soon as you copy it to your clipboard. So on your desktop, a window will pop up:

![QR sequence](readme_images/scan.png)

If we need more than one code, there will be a fast changing sequence of codes in this window, so that it takes maybe a couple of seconds to transfer all the data.

The app will also respond to specific links in the web browser (as described [here](#login-without-a-password)). Alternatively, you can copy the text format `oms00_....` of the message into the clipboard of your phone and paste it into the QR code scanner from the tool bar.

The App will then request the key from Android Keystore system. Android will ask you to scan your fingerprint, verify it and decrypt the message on behalf of the app ([here](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) are some technical details). Now you can either make your password visible by using the slider *reveal message*  or you just tell the app to *TYPE* the password back to your PC. See the next chapter for details.

## Setting Things Up
You will need [omsCompanion](https://github.com/stud0709/oms_companion) - the companion app for your desktop. omsCompanion will generate a private key for you and transfer it to your phone. You will also use it to encrypt your secrets with the public key and to send the encrypted data to your phone from your desktop. 

On your Android smartphone, you will need to set up the fingerprint authentification from your system settings. 

### Importing Your Private Key
omsCompanion will generate a private key for you. To import the key into your phone, you can use either the QR pop-up window from the *Cryptography -> New Private Key* wizard, or you can scan the codes from the backup document one by one. 

![private key import](readme_images/key_import.png)

You can change the key alias if there is a conflict with other keys.

Enter your transport password, click *DECRYPT* and then *SAVE*. 


### Setting Up Bluetooth
Once in the *Decrypted Message* screen, you can make your phone visible to other bluetooth devices (3) and connect from there (e.g. linking to your phone from your Windows PC. It will be registered as a keyboard). Select the target (2), make sure you have the correct keyboard layout (4) and press (5). If the the strokes are generated too fast for the target system (this is mostly the case if you are typing into Remote Desktop session), it can result in wrong entry. Please activate *delay* (6) in this case.

### On Keyboard Layouts
Long story short: select the *Keyboard Layout* (4) that matches that of your target PC. 

A keyboard is not aware of the layout. If you press ";" on the US keyboard, there is a key code behind it: 51. Depending on the keyboard layout of your operation system, your PC will make out of it: 
- ";" for English keyboard layout
- "√∂" for German keyboard layout
- "–∂" for Russian keyboard layout

...or the other way: if I wanted ";" to be typed from the German layout, I would send SHIFT + key code 54 instead. 

## Roadmap and Bugs
This software is being developed by one person, the amount of effort I can put into it is therefore limited. Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/stud0709/OneMoreSecret/issues) to file a bug or if you have a feature request.
