![Private Keys](/readme_images/private_keys.png)

This view allows you do delete private keys or share **public keys** by copying them to clipboard, sending to another app or [auto-typing](autotype.md).

If you generated your private key in the app or restored it and you are using [omsCompanion](https://github.com/stud0709/oms_companion), you will need to share the private key with it, if you want to encrypt passwords on your desktop PC directly.

## Public Keys
In contrast to private keys, public keys are safe to be shared with others. For a private key, there is always a corresponding public key. 

You encrypt a message using a *public* key. Once encrypted, you will need the *private* key to decrypt it.
