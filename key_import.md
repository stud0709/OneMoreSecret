# Key Import
![Key Import](/readme_images/key_import.png)

To import a Private Key, enter its transport password, click *DECRYPT* and then *SAVE*. 

## Key Alias
If you already have a private key with the same alias, a warning will be displayed. You cannot have multiple keys with the same alias - the older entry will be overwritten. 

You can however change the *key alias* if you want to retain the other key as well. 

You encrypted data does not refer to the key alias, it refers to the *fingerprint* of the key, which is unique. So feel free to rename keys if needed.
