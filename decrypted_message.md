# Decrypted Message

![Decrypted Message](./readme_images/decrypted_message.png)

The decrypted message is displayed on this screen. The text is hidden per default, you can make it visible with ![vilibility](./readme_images/visibility.png) if needed. 

You can use [auto-type](autotype.md) and other tools without making the text visible. The comment below the *TYPE* button shows, what piece of information is currently available.
