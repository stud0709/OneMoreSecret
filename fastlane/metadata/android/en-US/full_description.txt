<p><i>OneMoreSecret</i> is a standalone security layer for your data (e.g. passwords, more to come). It leverages the Android Keystore system, turning your phone into a hardware security module. In other words: with <i>OneMoreSecret</i>, you decrypt your secrets with your phone and your fingerprint.</p><p>No risk of compromising your entire password database through master password leak - every password is encrypted separately. Instead of a master password, <i>OneMoreSecret</i> relies on asymmetric cryptography.</p><p>Send the encrypted password to your smartphone from your PC through a sequence of QR codes, decrypt it and type the password backto the PC using a virtual Bluetooth keyboard.</p><p>See <a href='https://github.com/stud0709/OneMoreSecret#readme' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>project home page</a> for detailed introduction and tutorial.</p>
